# Analysis-of-E-Commerce-Transactions
## Overview

This project aims to analyze and explore e-commerce data, focusing on customer behavior, seller performance, product trends, payment methods, and shipping analysis. The project involves loading, cleaning, and preprocessing the data, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights and patterns.

## 1. Data Loading and Exploration

The data for this project was collected from multiple tables. The first step involved loading the datasets into the environment and getting an initial sense of their structure. This includes inspecting column names, data types, and checking for missing or irrelevant data.

## 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

### 1. Remove Irrelevant Columns  
Based on relevance to the analysis, the following columns were dropped:

- **Customers:** `customer_zip_code_prefix`, `customer_unique_id`
- **Order Items:** `order_item_id`, `shipping_limit_date`
- **Orders:** `order_approved_at`, `order_delivered_carrier_date`
- **Payments:** `payment_sequential`, `payment_installments`
- **Products:** `product_name_length`, `product_description_length`, `product_photos_qty`
- **Sellers:** `seller_zip_code_prefix`

### 2. Remove Duplicates
Any duplicate records were identified and removed to ensure the dataset's integrity.

### 3. Handle Missing Values  
Missing values in columns were filled appropriately or dropped, depending on the analysis requirements.

### 4. Data Type Optimization  
- Converted date columns to `datetime` format.
- Changed float64 columns to `float32` to optimize memory usage.

### 5. Data Consistency Check  
Ensured that dates were logically ordered (e.g., purchase date before delivery date).

### 6. Data Merging  
Merged various datasets (e.g., orders, products, payments, sellers, and customers) to create a unified dataset for analysis.
